# AI
CS50's Introduction of Artificial Intelligence with Python

## Search

### Degrees

Write a program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are using BFS algorithm.

I had to implement `the shortest_path` function such that it returns the shortest path from person with `id` source to person with the id `target`

### Tix-Tac-Toe

Using Minimax, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

I had to complete the implementations of `player`, `actions`, `result`, `winner`, `terminal`, `utility`, and `minimax`.

## Knowledge

### Knights

Write a program to solve logic puzzles.

I had to add knowledge to knowledge bases `knowledge0`, `knowledge1`, `knowledge2`, and `knowledge3` to solve the puzzles.

### Minesweeper

Write an AI to play Minesweeper.

I had to complete the implementations of the `Sentence` class and the `MinesweeperAI` class in minesweeper.py.
